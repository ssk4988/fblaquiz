This is Sachin Sivakumar's Submission for FBLA Mobile App Development: "FBLA Quiz".

************Background************
This project was written using React Native, a cross platform mobile 
app development framework created by Facebook. React Native uses javascript files as code
sources. For more information: https://facebook.github.io/react-native/

************Android .apk file************
The android .apk install file is in the root directory of this 
submission, /. This is the installable android app. It is found as 
/fbla-quiz-15be8545226b494892ff2f40e74337eb-signed.apk

************The folders************
There are two folders in this submission. /fbla-mobile-app-development/ is the
original project with the original source code, while /android-project/ is the
project configured for Android Studio. Before opening the folders you should 
install npm, open Command Prompt in each folder, and run npm install in each folder.

************Source Code************
The source code is the javascript .js files in /fbla-mobile-app-development/.
The code is split into several javascript files. The .json files are for 
configuration. The IDE used to develop the app is Snack by Expo. It is an online
IDE you can visit at snack.expo.io. To see my project on this IDE, go to 
snack.expo.io/@ssk4988/fbla-mobile-app-development. Any changes you make will
not affect the project as you will be editing a copy. Do not use the emulator 
to grade this project as it is unreliable in some ways.

************Android Studio Project************
To open the file in Android Studio, open Android Studio and choose the 
folder /android-project/android/ to open. This contains the Android Studio
elements. However, most of the source code for this is in /android-project
as javascript .js files. Be sure to have your SDK installed already or it
will prompt to install.
